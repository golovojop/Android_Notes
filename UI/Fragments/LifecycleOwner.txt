viewLifeCycleOwner:
-------------------
is LifecycleOwner that represents the Fragment's View lifecycle. In most cases, this mirrors the lifecycle of the Fragment itself,
but in cases of detached Fragments, the lifecycle of the Fragment can be considerably longer than the lifecycle of the View itself.

Fragment views get destroyed when a user navigates away from a fragment, even though the fragment itself is not destroyed.
This essentially creates two lifecycles, the lifecycle of the fragment, and the lifecycle of the fragment's view.

Referring to the fragment's lifecycle instead of the fragment view's lifecycle can cause subtle bugs when updating the fragment's view.
