 Allows the developer to register their app for a URI (uniform resource identifier) in the operating system once the app is installed.
 A URI can be any string without special characters, such as HTTP, pinterest, fb or myapp. Once registered, if you append ://  to the end 
 (e.g. pinterest://) and click this link, the Pinterest app will open up. If the Pinterest app is not installed, you’ll see a ‘Page Not Found’ error.
 
 Chrome intent is actually a powerful tool since it automatically handles the case of the app not being installed.
 
 
 Deep Linking with Android App Links (Android 6.0 +)
 ---------------------------------------------------
 
 Casual link example: https://imbd.com/title/12345
  
 If IMDB properly configures their website for app links, when IMDB is installed on the phone, it will open up immediately when the link is clicked.
 If the app is not installed, the web URL will be opened in a browser.
